# 🏆 Bounty Winner Announcement System

Automatically posts bounty winner announcements to the Snaps Feed via `@skateuser` account.

## 📋 Overview

When a bounty is completed and winners are selected in `BountyRewarder`, the system:

1. ✅ **Transfers HIVE/HBD** to winners (existing)
2. ✅ **Posts comment** on bounty thread (existing)
3. 🆕 **Posts announcement** to Snaps Feed via `@skateuser` (new!)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test Flow

1. **Create a test bounty** (or use existing)
2. **Add test submissions** with video URLs
3. **Select winners** in BountyRewarder modal
4. **Confirm transactions** in Keychain (2 popups)
5. **Check Snaps Feed** for announcement post

### What to verify:

- ✅ Post appears on https://skatehive.app (Snaps Feed)
- ✅ Posted by `@skateuser`
- ✅ Video is embedded correctly
- ✅ All winners listed with correct amounts
- ✅ Hashtags present
- ✅ Link to original bounty works

### Test with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bounty/announce-winner \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "winners": [
      {"username": "test123", "place": 1, "rewardAmount": 50.0}
    ],
    "bountyTitle": "Test Bounty",
    "bountyAuthor": "gnars",
    "bountyPermlink": "test-bounty-abc",
    "totalReward": 50.0,
    "currency": "HIVE"
  }'
```

## 🔍 Video Extraction

The system automatically extracts video URLs from winner's comments using these patterns:

- **YouTube:** `youtube.com/watch?v=` or `youtu.be/`
- **3Speak:** `3speak.tv/watch?v=`
- **IPFS:** `ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/` (or other gateways)
- **Direct links:** `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`

**Supported embed formats:**
- YouTube → iframe embed
- 3Speak → thumbnail + link
- IPFS → HTML5 video player
- Other → plain link

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The system uses **graceful degradation**:

- If video extraction fails → post without video
- If API call fails → rewards still sent, comment still posted
- If posting key missing → returns 500, logs error

**All errors logged with `[Bounty Announcement]` prefix.**

## 📊 Monitoring

Check logs for:

```
[Bounty Announcement] Processing 3 winners for: {bountyTitle}
[Video Extract] Found video for {username}: {url}
[Bounty Announcement] Success! Posted: @skateuser/{permlink}
```

Errors:

```
[Bounty Announcement] Error: {message}
[Video Extract] No video found in {username}'s comment
```

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Vercel

1. Add env var in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   SKATEUSER_POSTING_KEY=5K...
   ```

2. Redeploy:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Test with real bounty (low value first!)

---

## 🔒 Security

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**

- **Never commit** `SKATEUSER_POSTING_KEY` to git
- Store only in `.env.local` (gitignored) and Vercel
- Use **posting key** only (not active/owner keys)
- Rotate key if compromised

**Key permissions:**
- Posting key can: create posts, comments, votes
- Posting key CANNOT: transfer funds, change account

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Server configuration error"
- **Fix:** Add `SKATEUSER_POSTING_KEY` to `.env.local`

**Issue:** "Failed to post announcement"
- **Check:** Key is valid (`5K...`)
- **Check:** Hive API nodes are reachable
- **Check:** Account `@skateuser` exists

**Issue:** No video in announcement
- **Check:** Winner's comment contains video URL
- **Check:** URL matches supported patterns
- **Try:** Post comment with full YouTube URL

**Issue:** Transaction failed
- **Check:** `@skateuser` has enough RC (Resource Credits)
- **Wait:** A few minutes and try again
- **Check:** Hive blockchain status
